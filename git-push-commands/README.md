# Git Push/Pull Scripts

⚠️ **Important: Do not delete or move these scripts.** They are essential for pushing and pulling the "foundation" branch. Keep this folder intact during any project cleanup or restructuring.

## Scripts in this folder:

- `foundation.sh` - Push changes to the foundation branch
- `main.sh` - Push changes to the main branch

## Usage:

Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x ./git-push-commands/foundation.sh
chmod +x ./git-push-commands/main.sh
```

Run scripts:
```bash
./git-push-commands/foundation.sh
./git-push-commands/main.sh
```

## ⚠️ Protection Notice

These scripts are critical for maintaining the project's Git workflow. Do not:
- Delete this folder
- Move scripts to other locations
- Modify the core functionality without understanding the Git branch strategy

Keep this folder structure intact to ensure smooth project management.
